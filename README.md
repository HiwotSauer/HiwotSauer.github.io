<p>I am Hiwot Sauer, and my dream is to become a full-stack developer. I enjoy coding. There are always new things to learn in technology. I studied computer science at Northern Virginia Community College and Software engineering at Thinkful. </p>
<h3>In my free time, I love to do a lot of things.</h3>
<ul>
  <li>I do coding whenever I get the chance.</li> 
  <li>Even if I am not that good at swimming, I love playing in the water with my children.</li>
  <li>Cooking is therapy for me.</li>
  </ul>
<h3>I have three short term goals</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Become the best full-stack developer</li>
    <li>Travel the world</li>
    <li> Start and finish my software engineering course at Thinkful with great success. </li>
  
  </ol>
